          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <article>
            Often referred to as the "golden voice of Prague" and the "Sinatra
            of the East," celebrated Czech singer, actor, and painter Karel
            Gott's career spanned six decades and yielded hundreds of albums and
            compilations before his death in October of 2019. Emerging in the
            early '60s, Gott's first solo single, a rendering of Henry Mancini's
            “Moon River," helped put him on the map, and as the years progressed
            he dabbled in everything from pop, rock, and country to opera and
            swing. Able to entertain in Russian, English, German, and Italian,
            as well as his native Czech, Gott was hugely popular in Eastern
            Europe, but also found favor with audiences in Western Europe and
            the United States.

            Born on July 14, 1939 in the town of Pilson, Gott moved to Prague at
            the age of six. Initially intent on becoming an electrician, he was
            fascinated by jazz and began singing in public in the late '50s. By
            1960, he was studying opera and voice at Prague Conservatory under
            Konstantin Karenin, who taught Gott to embrace popular music as well
            as the classics. He released his first single, a duet with Vlasta
            Pruchova, on Supraphon Records in 1962. His first solo single
            appeared in 1963 as a Czech version of the aforementioned "Moon
            River." Gott subsequently ended his official studies at the
            conservatory, quickly building an impressive career as a singer and
            composer. In 1967 he signed with Polydor/Deutsche Grammophon, where
            he would remain for the entirety of his professional career,
            releasing over 100 albums and selling an estimated 50 to 100 million
            of them.

            Gott was diagnosed with cancer of the lymph nodes in 2015 but
            continued to perform and record. Sadly, in the summer of 2019, he
            developed acute leukemia and succumbed to the disease later that
            October. He released his final single, a duet with his daughter
            Charlotte titled "Srdce nehasnou" ("Hearts Will Go On"), earlier
            that year.
